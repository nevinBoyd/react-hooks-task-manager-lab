# Lab: Task Manager

## Overview
In this lab, weâ€™ll build a Task Manager application that allows users to add, complete, and search tasks. Utilizing the hooks of `useRef` to persist values without re-rendering, `useId` to generate unique IDs for accessibility and controlled components, and `useContext` for global state management.

## Task 1: Define the Problem
The frontend is set up, but the application lacks interactivity and state management.

As a user, I should be able to:
- Add a new task using a form (`useId`)
- Mark tasks as completed (`useContext`)
- Search tasks dynamically (`useRef`)

## Task 2: Determine the Design
Determine state and props needed for each component:
- Global states (`useContext`)
- Persistent Values (`useRef`)
- Unique IDs (`useId`)

## Task 3: Develop the Code
### Implement Global State with `useContext`
- Create `TaskProvider` as global state within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Replace tasks state in app with context

### Mark Task
- Implement `toggleComplete` function within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Call `toggleComplete` upon clicking task button

### Submit Tasks
- Apply `useId` on form input
- Implement `addTask` function within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Call `addTask` within submit

### Implement Search Functionality
- Implement `useRef` on search input
- Implement filter on task context

## Task 4: Test and Refine
Debug and test during development using the provided test suite and React DevTools in Chrome.

## Task 5: Document and Maintain
- Commit as you go, writing meaningful commit messages
- Push commit history to GitHub periodically and when lab is complete

## Tools and Resources
- GitHub Repo: 
- `useRef`: [React useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef)
- `useContext`: [React useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)
- `useId`: [React useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId)

## Instructions
### Set Up
Before we begin coding, let's complete the initial setup for this lesson:

#### Fork and Clone
- Go to the provided GitHub repository link.
- Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

#### Open and Run File
- Open the project in VSCode.
- Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

## Instructions
### Task 1: Define the Problem
The frontend is set up, but the application lacks interactivity and state management.

As a user, I should be able to:
- Add a new task using a form (`useId`)
- Mark tasks as completed (`useContext`)
- Search tasks dynamically (`useRef`)

### Task 2: Determine the Design
Determine state and props needed for each component.

### Task 3: Develop, Test, and Refine the Code
#### Open React application in browser
```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Run the included backend
```sh
npm run server
```

#### Run test suite
```sh
npm run test
```

### Create feature branch
#### Implement Global State with `useContext`
- Create `TaskProvider` as global state within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Replace tasks state in app with context
- Update `App` within `main.jsx` to be wrapped in `TaskProvider`

#### Mark Task
- Implement `toggleComplete` function within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Ensure `toggleComplete` function edits both the `db.json` and page
- Call `toggleComplete` upon clicking task button

#### Submit Tasks
- Apply `useId` on form input
- Implement `addTask` function within `TaskContext.jsx`
- Call `addTask` within submit

#### Implement Search Functionality
- Implement `useRef` on search input
- Implement filter task context on `TaskList`

### Push feature branch and open a PR on GitHub
- Merge to main

## Task 4: Document and Maintain
### Best Practice documentation steps:
- Add comments to code to explain purpose and logic
- Clarify intent/functionality of code to other developers
- Add screenshot of completed work included in Markdown in `README.md`
- Update `README.md` text to reflect the functionality of the application following [Make a README](https://makeareadme.com)
- Delete any stale branches on GitHub
- Remove unnecessary/commented-out code
- If needed, update `.gitignore` to remove sensitive data

## Submission
Once all tests are passing and working code is pushed to the GitHub main branch, submit your GitHub repo through Canvas using CodeGrade.

## Grading Criteria
The application passes all test suites.

Ensure the application:
- Loads tasks with context.
- Submits new task with `useId`
- Marks tasks as complete.
- Filters tasks shown on the page by a search input.

# Lab: Task Manager

## Overview
In this lab, we built a Task Manager application that allows users to add, complete, and search tasks.  
The app demonstrates how to manage global state with the Context API, use hooks effectively, and persist data to a local backend.

## Task 1: Define the Problem
The frontend was provided but lacked interactivity and shared state management.

As a user, I should be able to:
- Add a new task using a form (`useId`)
- Mark tasks as completed (`useContext`)
- Search tasks dynamically (`useState`)

## Task 2: Determine the Design
Determine which hooks and props were needed for each component.

- Global state (`useContext`)
- Persistent values (`useEffect`)
- Unique IDs (`useId`)

## Task 3: Develop the Code

### Implement Global State with `useContext`
- Created `TaskContext.jsx` to hold and manage all tasks globally  
- Wrapped `<App />` in `<TaskProvider>` inside `main.jsx`  
- Used `useEffect` to fetch and store data from `http://localhost:6001/tasks`

### Add New Tasks
- Implemented `addTask` to add new tasks and update both local and backend state  
- Used `useId` to provide a unique label identifier  
- Cleared input on submission

### Toggle Task Completion
- Implemented `toggleTask` to switch task completion state  
- Synced changes with backend using `PATCH` requests  
- Updated UI state immediately for real-time feedback

### Implement Search Functionality
- Used `useState` in `SearchBar.jsx` to track search input  
- Filtered visible tasks dynamically in `App.jsx`

## Task 4: Test and Refine
- Verified all CRUD operations using the provided Vitest test suite  
- Confirmed correct behavior for task addition, filtering, and toggling  
- Tested in browser to validate live updates and state syncing

## Task 5: Document and Maintain
- Committed frequently with descriptive messages  
- Ensured clear, consistent component separation and hook usage  
- Pushed final build to GitHub once all tests passed

## Learning Takeaways
- Learned how to manage shared state with React Context  
- Practiced creating and updating state immutably  
- Reinforced how `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` interact  
- Strengthened understanding of component separation and reusability  
- Saw how front-end state syncs seamlessly with a backend API  
- Improved ability to debug, test, and verify app behavior with Vitest

## Tools and Resources
- React  
- Context API  
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useId`  
- JSON Server (`http://localhost:6001/tasks`)  
- Vite environment
